1. It went smoothly up until introducing fixpoints. I had a hard time understanding fixpoints, and had to lookup what Inf was, which turned out to be a special type in Idris2. In addition, the Mu definition didn't click with me immediately so maybe focusing around those 2 things a little bit more would be less confusing for someone else.
2. I would recommend adding a couple of exercises around Fix to get familiar with it before moving on to using it in the exercises.
3. I didn't understand that Mu was sort of a "global" and needs to always be on the outside, is there any usage of having Mu on the inside? If not, maybe this could be encoded in the type to prevent Mu usage on the inside?
4. I would recommend going through the full implementation for NatDesc, NatTy, Z, S, and add, before moving on to implementing lists and then trees, rather than grouping the types for the 3 data structures as a single exercise so as to not write incorrect types 3 times before figuring out that my type definitions where wrong and having to redo everything 3 times again. (This happened to me :))
